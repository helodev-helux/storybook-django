# Storybook for Django

Storybook for Django is a UI development environment for your Django UI components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app. So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
cd my-django-project
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
# Once the project is set up,
npm install --save-dev storybook-django
```
